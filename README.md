# website-mern-stack

As the name suggested, the website-mern-stack is simply a website built with MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS (MERN). Here, users can sign up for an account, and thereafter, they can login any time using their credentials they have created.

The purpose of this application is mainly to get our hands on the MERN technologies and how to use them to develop a full-stack application. In this case, a website.
